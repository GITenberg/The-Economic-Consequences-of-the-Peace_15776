description: "The Economic Consequences of the Peace (1919) is a book written and\
  \ published by the British economist John Maynard Keynes. After the First World\
  \ War, Keynes attended the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 as a delegate of the British\
  \ Treasury. In his book, he argued for a much more generous peace, not out of a\
  \ desire for justice or fairness – these are aspects of the peace that Keynes does\
  \ not deal with – but for the sake of the economic well-being of all of Europe,\
  \ including the Allied Powers, which the Treaty of Versailles and its associated\
  \ treaties would prevent.\nThe book was a best-seller throughout the world and was\
  \ critical in establishing a general opinion that the treaties were a \"Carthaginian\
  \ peace\" designed to crush the defeated Central Powers, especially Germany. It\
  \ helped to consolidate American public opinion against the treaties and against\
  \ joining the League of Nations. The perception by much of the British public that\
  \ Germany had been treated unfairly was, in turn, a crucial factor in later public\
  \ support for the appeasement of Hitler.\nThe success of the book established Keynes'\
  \ reputation as a leading economist, especially on the left. When Keynes was a key\
  \ player in establishing the Bretton Woods system in 1944, he remembered the lessons\
  \ from Versailles as well as the Great Depression. The Marshall Plan, which was\
  \ promulgated to rebuild Europe after the Second World War, was similar to the system\
  \ proposed by Keynes in The Economic Consequences of the Peace.\n From Wikipedia\
